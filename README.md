ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hanif. My Net Programmer ID is BroColly.
<br>

ðŸ˜º I'm a finished student. So, I cannot continue my degree any further. Now, I'm working as a researcher. I like to sleep. I can sleep as long as a cat sleep. But that's not healthy. I'm not that great, but if you find my guidances / papers / articles helpful, I'm glad to know that.
<br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cross Reality Technology, Cross Platform Interaction Systems, and Human-Computer Interaction.
<br>

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and other topics that intrigue me.
